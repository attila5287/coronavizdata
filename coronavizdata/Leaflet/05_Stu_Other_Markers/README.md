# Other Markers

In this activity we will create three vector shapes to use as markers.

## Instructions

Using the `Unsolved` folder as a starting point, create the following vector layers and add them to the map:

1. A circle

2. A three-sided polygon

3. A polyline

## Hints

* The [logic.js](Unsolved/logic.js) file contains some suggested coordinates for each vector layer.

* Use the 'Vector Layers' section of the [Leaflet documentation](http://leafletjs.com/reference-1.0.3.html#toc) for reference:

* Make sure to give each shape a color property to make it visible!
