# City Markers

In this activity, we will create a map and plot markers for various cities.

## Instructions

1. For this activity you will be plotting markers for the following US cities:

   1. New York

   2. Los Angeles

   3. Houston

   4. Omaha

   5. Chicago

2. Create a marker for each city with a pop-up that displays that city's name and population. For this activity, you may either look up the population for each city, or make one up.

## Bonus

Pop-ups take in a string of HTML. If you finish early, try experimenting with passing in different tags or custom CSS!

## Hints

* A good first step might be to find coordinates for each city (use Google).

* Don't forget to add the marker to your map after creating it!
